# ðŸŽ®GamesDB
A web scraper in python using `requests` and `beautifulSoup` to parse game uploads from a videogame website, along with `pymongo` to smartly add the game entries into a local `MongoDB` database.
This way I can accomplish more complex searches and filters than what the original webiste provides.

## Maybe TODO:
- Try out alternative databases
- Encapsulate and refactor current implementation under the website name, to allow for other videogame website scrapers and parsers.
